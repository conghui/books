reallocation of the internal array of vector will invalidates all the 
references, pointers, and iterator for element of the vector.

insertion may invalidate reference, pointer, and reference of the element.

The concept of capacity of vector is similar to that of string.

If the vector is empty, calling front() and back() is undefined behaviors. So, you'd better test if it is empty, or use at().

begin() just return an iterator, which is implementation defined. So refer the address of the first element of the array, use &*begin() instead. 

You should always be aware of the invalidation of pointer, reference, and iterator
