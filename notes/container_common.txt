we can initialize and container from stdin, for example:
deque<int> coll((istream_iterator<int>(cin), (istream_iterator<int>())));
Notice that, we have to add the extra paranthese here. otherwise, It may be 
treated as a wrong function declaration.

empty() of container is more efficient than testing (size() == 0)

To check whether a container is less than another one, the lexicographical comparison is done.

assignment of container is expensive.

If the containers have the same type, and the source is no longer used, use swap() instead of assignment, swap() is constant time complexity.
