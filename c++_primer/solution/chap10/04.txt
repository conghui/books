Name two type conversions allowed on function arguments involved in template 
argument deduction.

Solution:
1. lvalue conversion, it includes lvalue to right value conversion, array to 
   pointer conversion, function to pointer conversion.
2. qualifier conversion. It includes the const and volatile keyword qualified 
   preceded by the  pointer.
3. derived class to base class conversion.
