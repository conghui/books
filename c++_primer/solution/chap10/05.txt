Given the following template definitions
template <class Type>
    Type min3( const Type* array, int size ) { /* ... */ }
template <class Type>
     Type min5( Type p1,Type p2 ) { /* ... */ }
which ones of the following calls, if any, are errors? Why?
double dobj1, dobj2;
float fobj1, fobj2;
char cobj1, cobj2;
int ai[5] = { 511, 16, 8, 63, 34 };
(a) min5( cobj2, 'c' );
(b) min5( dobj1, fobj1 );
(c) min3( ai, cobj1 );

solution:
(a) It is okay. The template function will be initialized to 
    char min5(char, char);

(b) Error occurs. for dobj1, the Type is initialized to type double. But for 
    jobj1, the Type is initialized to float. It is not allowed.

(c) The function is correct from the syntax. But runtime error may occur 
    because the cobj1 is not initialized.
