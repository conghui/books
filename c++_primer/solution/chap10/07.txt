Given the following template definition for sum()
template <class T1, class T2, class T3>
     T1 sum( T2, T3 );
which ones of the following calls, if any, are errors? Why?
double dobj1, dobj2;
float fobj1, fobj2;
char cobj1, cobj2;
(a) sum( dobj1, dobj2 );
(b) sum<double,double,double>( fobj1, fobj2 );
(c) sum<int>( cobj1, cobj2 );
(d) sum<double, ,double>( fobj2, dobj2 );

solution:
(a) Error. The compiler cannot deduce the return type of the function. we can 
have explicit specialization such as: sum<double>(dobj1, dobj2);

(b) Okay.

(c) Okay.

(d) Error. The second argument in the explicit specialization has to be given. 
on the other hand, we can leave the last argument empty.
