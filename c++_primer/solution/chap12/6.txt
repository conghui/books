Explain why each of the following is incorrect. Identify which errors are caught during compilation.
(a) const vector<string> file_names( sa, sa+6 );
    vector<string>::iterator it = file_names.begin()+2;
(b) const vector<int> ivec;
    fill( ivec.begin(), ivec.end(), ival );
(c) sort( ivec.begin(), ivec.rend() );
(d) list<int> ilist( ia, ia+6 );
    binary_search( ilist.begin(), ilist.end() );
(e) sort( ivec1.begin(), ivec2.end() );

solution:
(a) file_names is a constant vector, but it is a non-const iterator. It
should be changed to
    vector<string>::const_iterator it = file_names.begin() + 2;

(b) ivec has just been defined and no memory is allocated to it. What's more, it is const.

(c) the ivec is a const, thus the sort cannot operate on it.

(d) binary_search should a accept a random_access_iterator, the ilist only has bidirectional_iterator

(e) the iterator provided to the sort function should pointer to the same container.
