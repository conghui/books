Which, if any, of the following throw expressions are errors? Why? For the valid throw expressions, indicate the type of the exception thrown.
(a) class exceptionType { };
      throw exceptionType();
(b) int excpObj;
      throw excpObj;
(c) enum mathErr { overflow, underflow, zeroDivide };
      throw zeroDivide();
(d) int *pi = &excpObj;
      throw pi;

solution:
(a) Correct. The type is class exceptionType.

(b) Correct. The type is int.

(c) Invalid. zeroDivide is a enumerate constant. The right form is 
        throw zeroDivide;

(d) Correct. The type is int *.
