Which one of the following declarations and definitions would you put in a header file? In a program text
file? Explain why.
(a) int var;
(b) inline bool is_equal( const SmallInt &, const SmallInt & ) { }
(c) void putValues( int *arr, int size );
(d) const double pi = 3.1416;
(e) extern int total = 255;

solution:
(a) in the program text. It is a non-const definition.
(b) in the header file. It is a nice inline functin.
(c) in the header file. It is a function prototype (declaration).
(d) in the header file. It is a const definition.
(e) in the program text. It is a non-const definition.
