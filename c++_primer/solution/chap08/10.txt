Suppose we have the following:
    auto_ptr< string > ps( new string( "Daniel" ) );
What is the difference, if any, between the following two invocations of 
assign()? Which do you think is preferable? Why?
    ps.get()->assign( "Danny" );
    ps->assign( "Danny" );

solution:
1. the fist expression. we first get the pointer, a pointer to a string, and 
   then assign "Danny" to the string.

2. the second expression. we directly invoke auto_ptr<string>::assign() to 
   assign "Danny" to the object that auto_ptr points to. 

The second way is preferred. It is more intuitive and provides a way to 
handle the underling pointer.
