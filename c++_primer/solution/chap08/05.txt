Explain why the following new expressions are errors.
(a) const float *pf = new const float[100];
(b) double *pd = new double[10][getDim()];
(c) int (*pia2)[ 1024 ] = new int[ ][ 1024 ];
(d) const int *pci = new const int;

solution:
(a) we cannot initialize the array in new operator, including the const.
(b) the second dimension of the array must be a constant expression or 
constant value.
(c) the first dimension of array in the new operator must be given. It can be 
a const value or a normal expression, but we cannot leave it empty.
(d) the int should be initialized with a value once it has the const 
qualifier.
