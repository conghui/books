Why would you define your own namespace in your programs?

If we are the provider of the library, we want to keep the routine and 
functions in our namespace in case of name polution with the clients's 
program.

If we are the clients of the library, we also use namespace, but use the using 
namespace directive or using declaration in order to use the library.
