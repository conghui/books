Which ones of the following delete expressions, if any, are potential run-time errors? Why?
int globalObj;
char buf[1000];
void f() {
    int *pi = &globalObj;
    double *pd = 0;
    float *pf = new float(0);
    int *pa = new(buf)int[20];
     delete pi; // (a) error. the memory that pi points to is not from the 
                // heap.
     delete pd; // (b) OK. Although pd == 0, but C++ can guarantee that if the 
                // operand of delete is zero, then the delete expression 
                // doesn't make any difference.
     delete pf; // (c) Ok.
    delete[] pa; // (d) error. the memory that ps points to is buf, not from 
                //the heap.
}
