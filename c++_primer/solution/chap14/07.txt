For the class chosen in Exercise 14.3 of Section 14.2, determine if a
destructor is necessary. If not, explain why. Otherwise, provide its
implementation.

The destructor is used to return the resources that is allocated from the
heap. If there is no resources allocated from the heap, we don't need to
return it and so no destructor is needed.
