Which, if any, of the following statements are untrue? Why?
a.    A class must provide at least one constructor.
b.    A default constructor is a constructor with no parameters for its parameter list.
c.    If there are no meaningful default values for a class, the class should not provide a default constructor.
d.    If a class does not provide a default constructor explicitly, the compiler generates one automatically, initializing each data member to the default value of its associated type.


solution:
a. A class can have no constructor at all.

b. A default constructor is a constructor that the user can provide no
arguments to it when invoking it.

c. The class should provide a constructor for further use. It is needed in
some places, for example, the containers require their elements should have
default constructor or no constructor at all. And new expression also
require the object had better hava a default constructor.

d. If the class does not provide any constructor, the compiler will
generate such an constructor. But if the class has provided any
constructor, the compiler wound automatically generate any constructors for
it.
