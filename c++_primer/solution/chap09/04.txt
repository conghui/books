Which ones of the following initializations, if any, are errors? Why?
(a) void reset( int * );
    void (*pf)( void * ) = reset;
(b) int calc( int, int );
    int (*pf1)( int, int ) = calc;
(c) extern "C" int compute( int *, int );
    int (*pf3)( int*, int ) = compute;
(d) void (*pf4)( const matrix & ) = 0;

solution:
(a) Error. The argument list doesn't match.
(b) It is perfectly matched.
(c) It doesn't match. the pointer pf3 should also be qualified with extern 
    "C";
(d) OK.
