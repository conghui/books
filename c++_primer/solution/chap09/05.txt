What happens during the last (third) step of the function overload resolution 
process?

solution:
The third step is to find out the best matched function and using this 
function to respond the user's invokation.
The best viable function is the function for which the following applies:
1. The conversion applies to the arguments are not worse than the conversions 
   necessary to call any other viable functions.
2. The conversions on the same arguments are better than the conversions on 
   the same arguments when calling other viable functions.
