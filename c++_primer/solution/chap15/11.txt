Explain why a class designer should provide a class placement operator delete().

If a class has a user defined placement operator new() member function, 
and while in the construction stage of the class, and an exception is 
thrown, it will find whether a user defined class placement operator 
delete() is defined, if there is, the user defined class placement operator 
is called, otherwise, the memory leak results.
