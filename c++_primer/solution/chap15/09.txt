class iStack {
public:
   iStack( int capacity )
           : _stack( capacity ), _top( 0 ) {}
    // ...
private:
    int _top;
   vector< int > _stack;
};
(a) iStack *ps = new iStack(20);
(b) iStack *ps2 = new const iStack(15);
(c) iStack *ps 3 = new iStack[ 100 ];

solution:
(a) OK

(b) new const iStack(15) return a const iStack *, it cannot be assigned to
iStack *;

(c) class iStack doesn't have a default constructor. But in the operator
new[]() expression, the object should have a default constructor or no
constructor at all.
