Explain what happens in the following new and delete expressions:
class Exercise {
public:
    Exercise();
    ~Exercise();
};
Exercise *pe = new Exercise[20];
delete[] pe;

Change the new and delete expressions to call the global operators new()
and delete().

in the operator new[]() expression, it first check whether the class
Exercise have a user defined operator new[]() member function, if there is.
the user defined operator new[]() member function is called, otherwise, the
global new() function is called.

In the operator delete[]() expression, it first check whether the class
Exercise has a user defined operator delete[]() member function, if there
is, the user defined operator delete[]() member function is called,
otherwise, the global delete[]() function is called.

changes:
Exercise *pe = ::new Exercise[20];
::delete [] pe;
