The redeclaration of each of these functions is an error. Why?
(a) char *screenInit( int height, int width,
                      char background = ' ' );
    char *screenInit( int height = 24, int width,
                      char background );
(b) void print( int (*arr)[6], int size );
    void print( int (*arr)[5], int size );
(c) void manip( int *pi, int first, int end = 0 );
    void manip( int *pi, int first = 0, int end = 0 );

solution:
(a) once the first parameter is provided with default argument, the following 
    parameters should also be provided.
(b) redeclaration. Array is treated as a pointer when it is as a parameter.
(c) the third default argument value should be eliminated.
