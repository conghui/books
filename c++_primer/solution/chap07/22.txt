What are the types of the following declarations?
(a) int (*mpf)(vector<int>&);
(b) void (*apf[20])(double);
(c) void (*(*papf)[2])(int);
How would you use typedef names to make the declarations easier to read?

solution:
(a) mpf is a function pointer that points to a function, whose return type is 
int and it accept a argument, which is vector<int> &

(b) apf is an array of pointer to function, whose return type is void, and it 
parameter type is double. To make it easier to read, we can 
    typedef void (*PF)(double);
    PF apd[20];

(c) papf is a pointer that pointers to an array whose dimension is 2. the 
elements in the array is also a function pointer, with void as its return type 
and int as it parameter type. To make it easier to read, we can
    typedef void (*PF)(int);
    PF (*papf)[2];
