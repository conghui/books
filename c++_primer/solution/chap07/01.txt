 Which, if any, of the following function prototypes are invalid? Why?
    (a) set( int *, int );
    (b) void func();
    (c) string error( int );
    (d) arr[10] sum( int *, int );

solution: 
(a) It is invalid, the function prototype doesn't have return type.
(b) It is valid.
(c) It is valid.
(d) It is invalid. Array can not used as return type.
