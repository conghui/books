What potential run-time problem do you see with the following function 
definition?
vector<string> &readText( ) {
   vector<string> text;
   string word;
    while ( cin >> word ) {
      text.push_back( word );
      // ...
    }
   // ....
   return text;
}

solution:
The scope of the variable text is within the function body. However, the 
function's return type is a reference, making the return value invalid.
