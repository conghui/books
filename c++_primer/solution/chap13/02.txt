Explain the difference between a class declaration and a class definition. When would you use a class declaration? A class definition?

The class definition have the whole class defined, including the class
body, the member functions and the data members. But the class declaration
only has declaration just like the normal declaration.

If we want to define an object of the class, the class has to be defined
and it is a complete type. We then can refer the member of the class.

With only the class declaration, we can only define the pointers to that
class or references that refer to that class, but can not define the object
of that class, because the size of the class is unknown to the compiler,
the compiler don't know how much storage should be reserve to the
object.
