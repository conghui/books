==============

Solutions to some of exercise of several books. Some are finished, and some are 
still on their way out.

## DONE
- *C-Programming-Language* by *Brain W.Kernighan* and *Dennis M.Ritchie*
- *C++ Primer (3rd Edition)* by *Stanley Lippman* and *osee Lajoie*

## TO-DO
- *CUDA by Example: An Introduction to General-Purpose GPU Programming* by 
*Jason Sanders* and *Edward Kandrot*
- *Algorithms in C, Parts 1-4: Fundamentals, Data Structures, Sorting, 
    Searching* by *Robert Sedgewick*
- *STL Anotation* by *Jie Hou*

## Note
Each book is set to be a branch unless the exercise of the book is finish. Then 
the book will be merged into the master branch. Checkout the branch if you need 
to switch to different books.

I am not sure all of the exercise are correct, not even the best answer. But you 
can use it for learning and distributing with your modification.

Support and questions are appreciate, contact <mailto:heconghui@gmail.com>
