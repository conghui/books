Write the prototypes for each of the following functions:
    a.   A function named compare with two parameters that are references to a class named matrix
         and with a return value of type bool
                            
    b.   A function named extract with no parameters and returning a set of integers (where set is the
         container type defined in Section 6.13)

solution:
(a) bool compare(const matrix &ma, const matrix &mb);
(b) set<int> extract(vois);
