What are the two forms of return statement? Explain when you would use each form.

solution:
1. return ; This form is used when the function's return type is void.
2. return expression; This form is used when the function does require an 
   return type. The type of the expression should match the return type. Other 
   wise, implicit conversion will be performed if possible.
