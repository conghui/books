Explain the difference between these two statements:
int *pi0 = p2.get();
int *pi1 = p2.release();
Under what conditions would each respective invocation be more appropriate?

the get() method only return the object that it points to, but doesn't handle 
over its process. It is often used to test if a auto_ptr is initialized or 
not. But it should not be used in the auto_ptr declaration and initialization.

the release() method return the pointer of the auto_ptr and also handle over 
the process. It is often used in the auto_ptr initialization.
