Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of the following sets 
of declarations.
(a) int calc( int, int );
    int calc( const int, const int );
(b) int get();
      double get();
(c) int *reset( int * );
     double *reset( double * );
(d) extern "C" int compute( int *, int );
    extern "C" double compute( double *, double );

solution:
(a) It is an error declaration. In the argument list, const int and int cannot 
    be used to determine they are different overloaded functions.
(b) It is an error declaration. The return type can not be used to determine 
    they are different overloaded functions.
(c) It is an overloaded function.
(d) It is an error. An extern "C" can just not be put in front of different 
    functions with the same names.
