Given the following declarations, which function calls, if any, are in error? Why?
double calc( double );
int count( const string &, char );
void sum( vector<int> &, int );
vector<int> vec( 10 );
(a) calc( 23.4, 55.1 );
(b) count( "abcda", 'a' );
(c) sum( vec, 43.8 );
(d) calc( 66 );


solution:
(a). Error. The function call provides two arguments but the function prototype 
     only accept one parameter.
(b). It is OK. implicit convertion will be performed on "abcda", from const 
     char * to const string &.
(c). It is OK. implicit convertion will be performed on 43.8, from double to 
     int.
(d). It is OK. implicit convertion will be performed on 66, from int to 
     double.
