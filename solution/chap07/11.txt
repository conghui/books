How would you return more than one value from a function? Describe the 
advantages and disadvantages of your approach.

solution:
1. use the reference or pointer in the parameter. The advantage is that it is 
   easy to implement, but if more value should be returned, the number of 
   parameter will increase and thus the function prototype become urgly.
2. return a struct or class instead of a primitive type. The function 
   prototype  is quite neat and beautiful, but you should design the structure 
   or class yourself.
