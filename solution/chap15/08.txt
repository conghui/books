The class ScreenPtr can now represent a pointer that points to an array of 
Screen classes. Modify the overloaded operator*() and overloaded       
operator->() (defined in Section 15.6) to ensure that if the ScreenPtr 
object refers to an array element, the pointer does not re fer to one 
before the beginning of the array or to one past the end of the array. 
Hint: These overloaded operators should use the new data members size and 
offset.

Screen & ScreenPtr::operator*() {
    if (size == 0) {
        return *ptr;
    }
    assert(offset >= 0 && offset < size);
    return *ptr;
}

Screen* ScreenPtr::operator->() {
    if (size == 0) {
        return ptr;
    }

    assert(offset >= 0 && offset < size);
    return ptr;
}
